# Content

I realized 5 projects of deep learning.

- Project 1 : 
How to build a neural net from scratch using only Numpy as a dependency to predict [bike sharing rides]**https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset**
- Project 2 : 
How to build a convolutional neural network able to classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset]**https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html**
- Project 3 : 
How to generate tv scripts from the [Simpson's dataset of scripts]**https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data** using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Project 4 : 
How to train seq2seq models to translate English sentences to French 
- Project 5 : 
How to generate novel faces using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DC-GANs) from the [CelebA dataset]**http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html**
